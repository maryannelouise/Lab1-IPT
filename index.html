                I am Mary Anne Louise Parista Mabutas, born on February 20, 2004. My name is a mix of inspiration from
                my three wonderful grandmothers: Marcelina, Anna, and Louisa. According to my mother, each name shows a
                part of my personality. When my emotions take over, she jokingly calls me Mary when I’m frustrated or
                angry, Anne when I’m happy, and Louisa when I’m kind, just like my grandmothers.
                I am the third child of Wilson and Rosalie Mabutas. I was born in Agoo, La Union, where we lived for a
                few years before moving to San Fernando City, La Union. My siblings, in order of birth, are Marc Rowee,
                Welaine, and Mikah Rose. My older brother and sister have graduated and are now working in Japan, while
                my younger sister is a first-year college student taking up a Bachelor of Science in Education, majoring
                in English. I am currently a second-year college student studying Bachelor of Science in Information
                Technology.

                I am the third child of Wilson and Rosalie Mabutas. I was born in Agoo, La Union, where we lived for a
                few years before moving to San Fernando City, La Union. My siblings, in order of birth, are Marc Rowee,
                Welaine, and Mikah Rose. My older brother and sister have graduated and are now working in Japan, while
                my younger sister is a first-year college student taking up a Bachelor of Science in Education, majoring

                Technology.
                My childhood memories are somewhat blurry. I don’t remember everything, but I’ll share what I can
                recall. When I was born, both of my parents were working abroad, leaving us in the care of my
                grandparents in Agoo. During summer vacations, one or both of my parents would come home for a short
                visit, usually lasting just two to three weeks. This routine continued until the pandemic, when my
                parents stopped coming home because we began visiting them in Japan instead.
                My childhood experiences were simple. My little sister was my constant playmate, and we were
                inseparable. I was tasked with taking care of her since we were close in age, which made me very
                protective of her. We played together a lot but also fought frequently. I remember several instances
                where she cried because I hit her. But if you have a younger sibling, you know how much patience they
                can take away from you.

                My family has roots in both Agoo and Benguet. My grandmother from Benguet would take us there to spend
                time with our cousins. I’ll never forget how cold the mornings were when we woke up and tried to take a
                bath. My cousins had a flower farm, and their other grandmother sold the flowers. Like my parents, their
                parents also worked in Japan, but they lived far from ours.

                In Agoo, life was different. We stayed in my grandparents’ small house but still had fun even though the
                space was limited. Every New Year, we celebrate there. My aunts prepared gifts for everyone, and my
                grandmother would throw coins for us kids to grab. My cousins and I would compete to collect the most
                coins. These are some of my happiest memories.

                When we moved to San Fernando City, I started kindergarten at Saint Louis College (SLC). I remember how
                most of the kids cried because their parents were leaving them, but I sat quietly, just watching. I was
                already used to being away from my parents, so it didn’t bother me.
                I was very shy back then. I wouldn’t talk unless someone spoke to me first. I kept to myself and focused
                on what the teachers were saying. Even though I was quiet, I loved learning. Since kindergarten, I’ve
                been one of the top students in my class. I enjoyed studying because it helped me discover new things,
                and I loved the feeling of understanding something new.
                Another reason I worked so hard was my aunt. She had a strict way of making sure we focused on our
                studies. If we were lazy or didn’t take school seriously, she would scold us—and sometimes even hit us
                with a stick. Looking back, it was harsh, but it taught me the value of hard work and discipline.
                Because of this, I made sure to study hard and do my best in school. I set a goal for myself to be an
                honor student every year, and I worked hard to achieve it. It wasn’t always easy, but seeing my name on
                the honor roll and receiving awards made it all worth it.

                For elementary school, I moved to Christ the King College. This was a big change for me because I met so
                many new friends. While I don’t remember every detail, I know it was a fun and exciting time in my life.
                One
                of the most important things that happened there was meeting my long-time friend, Honey Jane. We built a
                strong friendship that has lasted to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                For high school, I went back to Saint Louis College and joined the science high school program. This is
                where I met friends who helped me get through high school. Agatha and Julia became my friends in grade
                7,
                while Erin, Honeychurch, and Sophia joined our group in grade 8. Each of them has made a big impact on
                my
                life, and I value them like family. I’m very thankful for their love and support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I’m in a new chapter of my life—college. I chose to study for a Bachelor of Science in Information
                Technology at Lorma Colleges because I’ve always been curious about computers and what they can do. This
                part of my journey hasn’t been easy. One of the biggest challenges has been adjusting to a new
                environment.
                My friends and I went to different schools and followed different paths, making it harder to see each
                other.
                Even so, we’ve managed to stay in touch, even if only for a short time.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this period of change, I’ve also made new friends, like Carizza and Kath, who have made my first
                year
                of college fun and bearable. I’ll admit, college is much harder and more challenging than high school.
                But I
                see it as an important part of my growth—a time to learn and prepare for my future career.

            As I go through this experience, I’m thankful for the support of both my old friends and the new ones I’ve
            made. We find ways to stay connected and keep our bonds strong, even with the distance. Despite the
            struggles, I remain hopeful. I know the knowledge and skills I’m gaining now will be valuable in shaping the
            future I want for myself.
